# clean-react-patterns

Cleaner, more readable way to arrange code for common React use cases. Mostly borne out of frustration reading code written by colleagues, bloggers, and I must admit, myself!

Hope this helps React beginners and practitioners alike, who wished somebody would have told them there was a way to avoid some of the clutter that we end up writing when trying to meet our deadlines.

Anybody who'd like to help out in this endeavour and/or correct me somewhere, is welcome.
